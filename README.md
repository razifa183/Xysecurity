🛡️ XySecurity –An AI Powered Network Traffic Analyzer

🔍 XySecurity is an intelligent, real-time network traffic analyzer tool designed to detect anomalies and potential cyber threats using machine learning. Built for modern cybersecurity needs, it provides high-accuracy detection of suspicious activity in live packet streams and helps mitigate zero-day vulnerabilities through proactive threat prediction.

⚡ XySecurity offers:

📡 Live Packet Monitoring: Continuously tracks network traffic (with features like protocol, IPs, flags, byte counts) and predicts whether each packet is Normal or Anomalous.

🧠 Machine Learning-Based Detection: Uses a trained Isolation Forest model to classify packets based on their behavior. The model was trained using real-world network traffic data and embedded into a live simulation environment.

🔐 Zero-Day Threat Identification: Detects abnormal behaviors not seen in past datasets, helping prevent new or previously unknown attacks.

📊 Interactive Reporting Dashboard: Provides visualizations including pie charts, anomaly trends, and downloadable logs for security auditing.

📈 Data-Driven Threat Management: Helps cybersecurity teams take data-backend decisions to reduce false positives

🔐 With XySecure, I combined real-time packet analysis and Isolation Forest ML models to detect anomalies and threats as they happen.
💡 Blending cybersecurity with machine learning to make networks safer, smarter, and faster to defend.
